# A3 Use Case - Cost on walls
## 3A - Analyse use case
### Goal of the tool
To calculate the cost af the materials in the walls
### Model Use
* Use Case - Cost Estiation
* Gather - Quantify
* Analyse - Forecast

## 3B - Propose a tool

### Description of the process of our tool
- We need to know which cost targets we need to find on the project. (for this task, we have chosen to make it for the exteriorwalls of the house.
- Then we need to have a model with all informations about the walls materials and dimentions (LOD400) - here we are workeing with the Duplex file.
- if the model has the necessary information, we can now proceed with the process.
- We will make a Python script to get all the informaions about the walls (How many walls, the diamentions and matetials)
- if the model has the necessary information, we can now proceed with the process.
- Then we want to make a HTML file to make the calculations og show the time and cost schedule.
- if this is fine then we can handle it over to the Clint.

## 3C - Information exchange
### Beslut hvilke elementer vi ksal bruge og vælg detaljegrad (LOD400?)
### 
- We need to know the dimentions and materials of all the walls
Openings(Windows/doors) 
- We need to know the dimentions og the openings in the walls
- We have to tjek that the outputs is okay acording to the BR18, A1 and A2 documents for the project and the building specifications documents.

## 3D - Value what is the potential improvement offered by this tool
### This will make the contractors to know exatly how much work they need to put a price on. and then can the Client chuse hwo has to make the work.
### This will make les waste of building materials and a more presice prise for the work. 

## 3E - Delivery
### We will try to make a HTML where you can klik on a level and then you will see the results of the defrint wall types, materials and diamentions så the contractor kan calculate the exate price for the prodution.
